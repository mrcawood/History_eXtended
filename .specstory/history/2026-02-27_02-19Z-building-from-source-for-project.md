# Building from source for project (2026-02-27 02:19Z)

_**User**_

we need go @/home/mcawood/.cursor/projects/home-mcawood-projects-History-eXtended/terminals/7.txt:24-43 

maybe build from source ?

**Installing go**

I'm installing Go via snap with classic confinement to resolve the access denied error. I'm considering building Go from source as an alternative to using snap. I found that building Go from source requires a pre-existing Go installation or the use of gcc for bootstrapping. I'll use the binary distribution for simplicity since building from source requires bootstrapping with Go 1.4. </details></think>

You have a few ways to get Go installed:

## Option 1: Snap with `--classic` (simplest)

The snap install failed because the `go` snap uses classic confinement. Use:

```bash
sudo snap install go --classic
```

This is usually the quickest way.

---

## Option 2: Official binary tarball

Install directly from the official release without snap:

```bash
# Download latest Go (check https://go.dev/dl/ for current version)
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.22.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.22.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Then remove the tarball:

```bash
rm go1.22.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

## Option 3: Build from source

Bootstrapping Go from source needs either an existing Go install or a C toolchain. The usual process:

1. Install build deps:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install build-essential git
   ```

2. Clone and build:
   ```bash
   git clone https://go.googlesource.com/go
   cd go/src
   ./all.bash
   ```

`all.bash` will use the C-based bootstrap (Go 1.4) to build the current Go. This takes longer (often 10–20 minutes) and more disk space.

**Practical order of preference**

1. **Snap**: `sudo snap install go --classic`
2. **Binary tarball** if you prefer to avoid snap
3. **Source build** only if you specifically need a custom build or a particular development version
